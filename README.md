A collecton of notebooks and scripts that i have made during my time as TA in DAT200 and taking the course myself.


The assignments are applied machine learning, and the predictions from the models are added to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)


Black is used for the formatting of the notebooks in a workflow. [Here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/github_actions.html#usage)
